# yahoo_news_headline
Read aloud the selected news in Yahoo News Japan headlines
This script is for practice to use Google Text-to-Speech feature.
Normal reading speed in Japanese is too slow then this script uses mplayer (http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html) as pre-requisite.
It can be run without mplayer if you modify the gen_sound_file part.
It gets error with some articles with long body text or in irregular format. I plan to update to support them or make it not gives errors.
